- ssl/tls support
    - this means more generalization of the gen_listener_tcp behaviour
    to support pre_listen, post_listen, pre_accept and post_accept hooks,
    this will allow us more gracefully interfere with the connections.

    - Note that we need to carry StateData as we support the various
    callback hooks, which means, we need to update the init/1 return
    type definition.

- erlang client
    - We need a native erlang client, which will connect via tcp/ip
    and use a gen_event to allow easy reaction to published events.

- unittests
    - we don't have any right now. we should be able to isolate
    and unittest the core parts of this application, even though
    most of it is simple

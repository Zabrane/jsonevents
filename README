JsonEvents is an events broadcaster, 
that broadcasts events as JSON objects.

All connected clients, recieve ALL events,
there is NO NOTION of channels, or subscriptions,
and there is no intention to change this decision.

This is not a message queing system... this is NOT
a poor man's RABBITMQ, if you want a poor man's RABBITMQ,
get RABBITMQ, its FREE, poor men can afford it ;)

Basically, an event broadcaster pushes events to the bus,
and interested parties connects to the tcp/ip listening socket.
From then on, ANY event that is pushed to the bus is recieved by
all connected clients in JSON representation.

The clients can use a simple gen_events module to handle the
recieved events. Overtime, such a behaviour may be included
in this app.

Its hoped to be pretty minimal and easy to setup and reuse,
and will feature optional ssl/tls support for the
paranoid consumers :)

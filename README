JsonEvents is a tcp/ip event notifier.

Basically, an interested party connects to it on
a listening socket, and any event that is genereted
on the remote end of the bus is published to
all connected clients in JSON representation.

Its hoped to be pretty minimal and easy to setup and reuse,
and will feature optional ssl/tls support for the
paranoid consumers :)
